# Policy-Newton-RL
Experiments for policy Newton algorithm for RL.

These experiments are performed on the Cartpole environment with linear function approximation. Implemented three algorithms - policy gradient (REINFORCE), policy Newton and perturb gradient descent.

The resulting plot is the average episodic reward over 20 seeds which can be accessed from [output.png](output.png) file.
